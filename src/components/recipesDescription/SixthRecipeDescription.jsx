            list3="1 tablespoon maple syrup"

            list4="1 tablespoon fresh lime juice"

            list5="2 tablespoons olive oil"

            list7="1 teaspoon kosher salt"

            step1="Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cool water; set aside."

            step2="Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add kale, 1/4 cup of the scallions, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly with tongs, until greens are just wilted and tender, and garlic and onions are glossy and almost translucent, about 2 minutes. Add sauce to greens and cook until slightly thickened and darkened in color, about 1 to 2 more minutes."

            step3="Add cooked noodles and cook, until sauce is bubbling where it pools, about 2 to 3 minutes, gradually adding remaining 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if more sauce is needed to coat the noodles."

            step4="Top with cucumber, remaining 1/4 cup scallions, and sesame seeds. Drizzle with sesame oil and serve warm with lime wedges."
