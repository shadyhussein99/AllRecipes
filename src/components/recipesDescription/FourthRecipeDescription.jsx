            list1="14 slices brioche bread"

            list2="7 tablespoons peanut butter"

            list3="7 tablespoons jam"

            list4="3 large eggs"

            list5="2 tablespoons honey"

            list6="2 teaspoons vanilla extract"

            list7="1/4 teaspoon salt"

            list8="1 cup milk"

            list9="1 tablespoon confectioners sugar, or as needed"

            list10="1 tablespoon maple syrup, or as needed"

            step1="Spray an 8x12-inch to 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray, and set aside. Spread half of bread slices with peanut butter, and the remainder with jelly, 1 tablespoon each slice. Make 7 sandwiches by combining a peanut butter bread slice with a jelly bread slice."

            step2="Brioche is pretty square in shape, so quarter each sandwich, making a total of 28 mini sandwiches. If your bread is a different shape, you may want to consider cutting the mini sandwiches differently. Place the mini sandwiches in rows, cut sides up, in the prepared baking dish, arranging the rows right next to each other."

            step3="Make custard: Whisk milk, eggs, honey, vanilla, and salt in a bowl. Drizzle custard over sandwiches, making sure each is well coated. Don't worry if custard pools at the bottom of the dish-the bread will soak it up. Cover casserole with foil, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight."

            step4="Bake casserole in the preheated oven, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove foil, and bake until sandwiches start to crisp and turn golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes more. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar or drizzle with maple syrup."
