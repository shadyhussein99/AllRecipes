            description="Of all the cakes that could be converted into ice creams, carrot cake might not be the first cake that comes to mind, but this turned out incredibly well. This is a no-churn ice cream and you don't need an ice cream maker."

            list1="2 tablespoons unsalted butter"

            list2="1 1/4 cups finely shredded carrots"

            list3="1/3 cup brown sugar"

            list4="1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"

            list5="1/4 teaspoons cinnamon"

            list6="1/2 teaspoon ground ginger"

            list7="4 ounces soft cream cheese"

            list9="1 teaspoon vanilla extract"

            list10="1/4 cups heavy cream"

            step1="Combine butter, carrots, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until carrots are just getting tender, about 5 minutes. Season with cinnamon and ginger. Cook for 1 more minute. Turn off heat, and let cool."

            step2="Meanwhile, whisk together cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Stir in cooled carrot mixture and transfer to the refrigerator until needed."

            step3="Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until medium-stiff  peaks form. Add cooled carrot-cream cheese mixture and whisk into the whipped cream. Fold in chopped walnuts and pecans with a spatula."

            step4="Transfer mixture into a chilled airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the mixture. Cover with a lid and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours, but best overnight."
